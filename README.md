Clustering of Analogies for Inter-Language Similarities

Recent works have allowed to efficiently solve morphological analogies like “think is to thought as bring is to brought” using NNs [1, 2]. Those results, available
in multiple languages, might be used to understand the properties of analogy and to refine language hierarchies by exploring the latent space of the models.

Project goal: use clustering methods to explore, visualize and analyze the latent space of deep learning models of morphological analogy.
